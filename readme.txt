Sl0thdan is a python script that utilized the Shodan API written by yours truly.

Why?

Wile working with some pretty cool people, we realized that we were too lazy to actually use shodan.
It then hit me that shodan had an api...AND a python lib. Done and done. 

For now, it shall remain basic. I do plan on making it better and more pretty.

YOU NEED THE SHODAN LIBRARY!!!!

easy_install shodan

Windows is not fun because it doesn't always create links to things. So, you may have to download easy_install and do everything 
manually.


NOTE: to use the subnet search, you will need access to the unlocked shodan api. It limits you to 100 queries a month,
which isn't bad at all for such a nice service.
